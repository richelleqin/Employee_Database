# Employee_Database
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This is to help Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami” as the current employees reach retirement age. 
## Results
- There are 133,777 records of employees born between 1952 to 1955. There are however duplicate records for employees due to their different career journeys either through promotion or change of roles. Removing duplicates in this table, we see that there are 90,399 employees in total, whereas the currently working employees (from unique titles table) amount to 72,459. This suggests that 17,940 employees are already retired.
- Further to Finding 1, we found the number of retiring employees per title as shown in the screenshot. If this holds true, the company will have a massive need for Senior Engineers and Senior Staff positions to fill, as together these senior positions make up for 70% of the retiring workforce.

- We find that employees eligible for mentorship ranges in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles, around 70% of their age group’s workforce. This is good as the most beneficial mentorship will come from the senior roles and we have the resource to offer mentorship to junior positions to enable them to fill the gap from the retirees.

- We find the most employees eligible for mentorship have between 23 to 29 years of experience. Also everyone eligible have over 20 years of experience. This means that the mentorship they provide will be more beneficial and come from a place of experience in the company.

- If we assume the retirement age is 65, then there will need to be 93,409 roles that needs to be filled for the “silver tsunami”.
- There are 65,377 qualified, senior level, retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
